  * Linked List (Single and Double)
      - Traversing a list
      - Search a list
      - Add a node to a list
      - Delete a node from a list
      - x->next; x->previous

  * Queue (Array and Linke List implementation)
      - how they're similar and different
      - Enqueue and Dequeue
      - how do they change the state of the queue
      - what is the purpose of checking whether a queue is full or empty
      - Circular array - state of queue after enequeue and dequeue operations

  * Stack
      - push and pop
      - state of stack after a seqeuence of operations
      - array and linked list implementation

  * BST
      - Traverse a tree
      - Add a node to a tree
      - Search a  tree
      - Delete a node and identify the replacement
      - understand pointers for parent and children
      - no recursion

  Circular queue
  --------------
    * Enqueue adds at tail
    * Dequeue removes at head

  Stack
  -----
    * Push - add to stack
    * Pop - remove from stack
